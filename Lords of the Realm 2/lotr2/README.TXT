DOS PROBLEMS and SOLUTIONS

Lords of the Realm 2 requires at least 6MB of free XMS RAM for itself.  If you are short on RAM, you should edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and comment out all non-essential items.  Lords 2 requires a mouse, CD ROM, sound, and video drivers.  If you are not familiar editing your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, please consult the manual that came with your computer for detailed instructions.
If you want to play the DOS version of Lords 2 and you are a Windows 95 user (which you may wish to do if your PC has compatibility conflicts with Direct X 3) you will need to reboot to your previous version of DOS.




GENERAL TECH TIPS 

Disk Fragmentation:
If your hard drive is highly fragmented, you may experience a looping problem with the sounds in the game.  If the sound effects in the game are repeating, defragging your hard drive with DOS's "Defrag" should fix the problem.  Simply type "DFRAG" at your DOS prompt to load this tool.

Copy Protection:
You must have the game CD ROM in your drive to run the game, except as stated below for spawning.

Network Support:
The DOS version of Lords of the Realm 2 does not support networking or modem play.  To use these features you must use the Windoes95 version.




GAME ADDITIONS

Be sure to visit our website (http://www.sierra.com) for additional game maps.  These will be released shortly after the game reaches the stores.  Planned maps include: USA, WORLD, MEDITERRANEAN, some designed specially for multi-player fun, and more... 

Hot-key Summary 
Pressing H or V in combat while a group is selected will form the group into a horizontal or vertical line, respectively. 
Pressing "Alt" and a number key simultaneously while a group is selected will assign that group to the number pressed.  This number then acts as a hot-key to reselect that group of units for the remainder of the battle.  However, if any of the units assigned to such hot-keys are selected again with the mouse, they will no longer be assigned to the hot-key.  Hot keys are automatically assigned to the starting groups for each army at the start of a battle: press keys 1 through 0 to view these groups. Up to 10 groups can be formed. Groups can contain mixed melee units but NOT a mix of melee and archers or crossbows.

Mouse Controls  
In combat, right clicking on the overview map will center your view on the area selected.  Left clicking on the overview map will order any units selected to the area clicked on.
On the advanced labor panel, a double click in the center of this pop-up will take all idle workers in the county and assign them to grain/cow farming, up to the minimum level needed in these areas, and then place the rest in the town center where they can all be lassoed at once and reassigned.

Contiguous Counties
Counties that border each other diagonally are not adjacent for purposes of contiguity.  Counties must share a border along the side of at least one square to be contiguous.

Army Movement Pause
In single player games, pop-up messages will pause all army movement.  This gives players time to read messages without worrying about computer player movement.




MANUAL CORRECTIONS

Help (pg11)  The entire manual is available on-line from the Help menu. Choose 'Help', then 'Game Help' and then 'Start Game Help' to launch the on-line manual.

Play Now!! (pg13) is a campaign game.  This links eight of the maps into a campaign that will get progressively more difficult with each map (and contains at least one hidden surprise).  The 'custom' settings for each of these maps are preset, except for the advanced settings of Farming, Foraging and Exploration, which you can use or not at your pleasure.

Ale (pg28)  To get any benefit from ale, you must purchase at least 1 barrel of ale for every 10 people in your county.  Once you do this, a +1 Happiness indicator will appear on the purchase ale pop-up.  You can increase the happiness effect up to a maximum of +5 by purchasing more ale at the same ratio of 1:10 for each level of happiness.

Population Growth. (pg29)  Birth rate depends on happiness, death rate depends on health.  Rations have an indirect effect on both birth and death in that it affects both happiness and health.

Field Reclamation. (pg41)  Multiple fields can be simultaneously reclaimed in a county.  Any given field will always take a minimum of 4 seasons to reclaim.  However, if you assign more workers than are needed for reclamation of one field, the remainder will work on a second field that is set for reclamation.  The only limit to the number of fields that can be simultaneously reclaimed is your population.  Note that labor is not divided equally between fields; a field will be assigned the maximum number of workers that it needs before any will work on a subsequent field.

Herd Overcrowding (pg42)  There are four states of overcrowding:  low herd crowding, average herd crowding, overcrowded, and massive overcrowding.  Crowding directly affects the birth and death rates of your herd.  You can see the crowding status by clicking on any cow field or by clicking on the dairy maid section in the advanced labor panel.  The graphics on the map give a good indication of crowding level, but there is no graphical distinction between overcrowding and massive overcrowding.

Blacksmiths and Resources (pg48)  Any blacksmith that is active is assigned a portion of your global resources for his work that is based on the total number of blacksmiths that are 'on'.  Be aware that turning a blacksmith on will reduce the resources available to other blacksmiths and can change the labor allocation of counties that have already been adjusted that turn.

Castle Building and Resources (pg50)  You may not allocate any labor to castle construction until all resources for the castle have been collected.  The info panel will display a wood and/or stone icon next to the castle building icon in any county that has started building a castle but has insufficient resources to begin construction.  Wood will not be shared with blacksmiths: any resources collected are immediately and irrevocably assigned to the castle under construction unless castle construction is 'off' in that county.  Turning castle construction 'off' can also be useful if multiple counties are constructing castles: castles with construction 'on' are assigned resources, castles with construction 'off' are not, allowing you to decide which castles will get resources first.

Altering Castles (pg53)  You may not downgrade castles.

Castle Garrisons & Foraging (pg54)  Armies in castles forage for themselves, and therefore do not eat from county stores.  When foraging is on, building large castles and keeping your army inside is an effective way of avoiding starvation problems.

Army Wages (pg68)  You will be warned the first time you fail to pay army wages.  If you fail to pay them on subsequent turns, some of your troops will desert each turn until a mutiny occurs.  Pay careful attention to the messages that appear at the start of each turn.  These messages will tell you if any men have deserted or if a mutiny is imminent.

Splitting Armies (pg75)  Armies can be split at three different times/circumstances:
1)  An army normally can only be split only at the start of its movement in a turn.  Splitting does not use all the movement for a turn, but cannot be done if the army has used any movement points that turn.
2)  Splitting out of castles.  Armies in castles can be split as follows:  the 'daughter' army (to the right of the Split Army screen, this starts out with zero men) will leave the castle while the 'parent' remains as garrison.
3)  Splitting into castles.  If you try to move an army into a castle with a garrison limit smaller than the combined size of your army and the current garrison, you will be asked if you wish to split your army.  The 'daughter' army will advance into the castle.  When splitting into castles, you may split off less than 50 men.  This will make it much easier to bring a current garrison up to its maximum size.

Disbanding Armies (pg75)  Right-clicking on an army accesses an information pop-up that includes the army's county of origin.  This is the county that your troops will return to if they are disbanded.  Any weapons they are carrying are returned to your treasury.  If you no longer control an army's county of origin, you can only disband it by moving it to any friendly county before disbanding it.  The army will join the population of the county they are in.

Capturing Counties (pg76)  All county towns (player, AI, or neutral) will defend themselves with a portion of the population of the county.  If a friendly army is adjacent to a county town that is attacked, that army will defend the county instead.  If a garrisoned castle is present in the county, it must be attacked instead of the county town to gain control of the county.

Retreats (pg82)  Armies that retreat will suffer some casualties.  Any army that would have less than 50 men after retreating is eliminated instead.

Besieged Castles (p.87)  When one of your castles is under siege, you may only leave the castle to engage the sieging force, and you may not enter the castle or strengthen the garrison until the siege is lifted.

Siege Towers (pg91)  Once siege towers reach a wall and 'dock' with it, they can not be moved again.

Boiling Oil (pg94)  Oil is designed for use by the besieged for defense of the castle.  Trying to move oil out of any door will register as an attack order and dump the oil.

Drawbridge (pg95)  Note that only the Stone and Royal castles have drawbridges.  Within a siege, drawbridges can not be closed once they have been opened.

Army Foraging (pg107)  Soldiers that don't eat starve and desert.  Armies will always try to eat normal rations regardless of the ration level set in the county.  If an army does not achieve at least half rations, you will be warned.  On subsequent turns, if the army still doesn't eat, some of the soldiers in that army will die/desert each turn.  If this condition persists for more than a few turns, the entire remaining army will leave your service.  As with wages, pay attention to the messages at the start of your turn to get a feel for the effects of starvation on your army.  In addition, right-clicking on any army will provide information about its current health (this only applies with foraging on).

Custom Games (pg109)  The Difficulty Level determines how challenging the computer opponents will be, and also how many usable fields are in each county at the start of a game.  County status determines the starting population, number of cows, amount of grain, health and happiness of counties at the start of the game, but not the number of usable fields.

Overpopulation (pg115, #5)  You may no longer slaughter your own villagers (this was too brutal for even the 13th century).

Quaintville (pg128)  The Quaintville map was completely changed.  The new map is an 'N' shaped map for 2 players only and contains 4 counties.  This is the first map of the campaign (Play Now!!).  This is a perfectly balanced 2-player kingdom.  There are two sets of roads on this map: one that connects all county squares and one that provides shortcuts between county squares of non-adjacent counties.  Some off-road movement can also shorten travel time.   The starting counties are contiguous even though it is not possible to move directly between them.

Credits (pg2)  Ken Parker's true name has mistakenly been revealed.  Please cross this out and replace it with 'Spiderman' or 'Der Schpeidermeister' before any of his many enemies discover this information.  Further, Doug Gonya should be identified as 'Testenfuhrer' (of course, the German version of the game already has this title correct).  Finally, Steve Grammont is only known as 'QA Manager' to assuage his ego; in fact, he has no known function at Impressions.
